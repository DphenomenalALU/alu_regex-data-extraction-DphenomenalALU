# Regex Data Extraction â€” Onboarding Hackaton

## Project Overview

This Python project demonstrates the use of Regular Expressions (Regex) for extracting various types of data from text input. It includes regex patterns for extracting:

- Email addresses
- URLs
- Phone numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Time formats (12-hour and 24-hour)
- HTML tags
- Hashtags
- Currency amounts

## Features

- Extracts various data types from a sample text:
  - Email addresses
  - URLs
  - Phone numbers (supports different formats)
  - Credit card numbers (supports different formats)
  - Time formats (supports both 12-hour and 24-hour formats)
  - HTML tags
  - Hashtags
  - Currency amounts
- Each type of data is extracted using a regular expression pattern, and the results are displayed clearly.
- Unit tests are included to verify the correctness of each regex pattern against different edge cases.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Python `unittest` library (included in the standard library)
- No external dependencies are required.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DphenomenalALU/alu_regex-data-extraction-DphenomenalALU.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd alu_regex-data-extraction-DphenomenalALU
   ```

3. **Ensure Python 3.x is installed:**
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

## File Structure

```
alu_regex-data-extraction-DphenomenalALU/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ extractor.py        # Script that contains the regex patterns and extraction logic
â”œâ”€â”€ tests.py            # Unit test file to validate regex patterns
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # Project overview and setup instructions
```

## Usage

1. **Run the extraction script:**

   To run the script and see the data extraction in action, simply run the `extractor.py` file:

   ```bash
   python3 extractor.py
   ```

   This will output the extracted data, such as email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, etc., based on the sample text in the script.

2. **Run the unit tests:**

   To ensure the accuracy of your regex patterns, you can run the tests using the `unittest` module:

   ```bash
   python3 -m unittest tests.py
   ```

   This will run all the test cases and output the results, confirming whether the regex patterns are working as expected.

## How It Works

### Extractor Script (`extractor.py`)

1. **Regex Patterns:**
   The script uses Python's `re` library to define regex patterns for each data type. Each pattern is designed to match specific formats (e.g., email, URL, phone number).

2. **Text Processing:**
   The script processes a sample string (`sample_text`) that contains various data examples. It applies the regex patterns to find all matches and stores the results in corresponding variables.

3. **Output:**
   The extracted data is printed in a labeled format for easy reading.

### Unit Tests (`tests.py`)

1. **Test Setup:**
   The test file uses Python's built-in `unittest` module to define test cases for each regex pattern. Each test verifies that the regex correctly identifies valid data and ignores invalid data.

2. **Test Cases:**
   - **Emails:** Checks for various valid and invalid email formats.
   - **URLs:** Validates that only well-formed URLs are extracted.
   - **Phone Numbers:** Verifies multiple phone number formats.
   - **Credit Card Numbers:** Tests different formats of credit card numbers.
   - **Times:** Ensures correct extraction of time formats (12-hour and 24-hour).
   - **HTML Tags:** Validates the extraction of HTML tags.
   - **Hashtags:** Checks if hashtags are correctly identified.
   - **Currency Amounts:** Ensures proper extraction of currency amounts.

## Edge Cases Handled

- **Emails:**
  - Handles different valid email formats (e.g., with subdomains, aliases).
  - Ignores invalid email formats (e.g., missing "@" symbol).
  
- **URLs:**
  - Supports both HTTP and HTTPS URLs.
  - Ignores invalid URLs without a valid scheme or domain.

- **Phone Numbers:**
  - Supports various formats like `(123) 456-7890`, `123-456-7890`, and `123.456.7890`.
  - Handles international numbers and non-standard formats.

- **Credit Cards:**
  - Recognizes both spaced and hyphenated formats for credit card numbers.
  - Ignores numbers that don't match typical credit card patterns.

- **Times:**
  - Supports 24-hour (`HH:MM`) and 12-hour (`HH:MM AM/PM`) formats.
  - Ignores invalid times (e.g., 25:99 or 99:99 PM).

- **HTML Tags:**
  - Matches standard HTML tags.
  - Ignores malformed or unrecognized tags.

- **Hashtags:**
  - Correctly identifies hashtags in text.
  - Ignores non-hashtag words.

- **Currency Amounts:**
  - Recognizes dollar amounts with or without commas and decimal places.
  - Ignores non-currency values (e.g., "100dollars" or "â‚¬45.00").
